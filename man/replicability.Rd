\description{
This function implements the computation of  Krippendorff's Alpha as per
https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1043&context=asc_papers # nolint
}
\details{
It is designed to be space efficient for sparse oberverments, and as thus
does not take as input a reliability matrix, but a long-format data.table

Supports nominal and binary data.

If a tibble or a non-data.table dataframe is passed as input, this function
will still work! It will silently create a data.table copy of your dataframe
(or tibble).

There are two possible types of input:
- The "extended" form: a tidy table of individual votes, where each row is
one measurement of one unit by one coder. This is typically the raw data
coming out of an annotation database. The user just needs to specify which
column contains the unit ID, and which column contains the measurement. Each
measurement takes one of the possible values of the nominal variable.
- The "aggregated" form: a tidy table of frequencies of votes per unit, where
each row is the number of measurements for one unit for one nominal value.
The user needs to specify which column contains the unit ID, which column
contains the measurement value (amongst one of the possible values of the
nominal variable), and which column contains the frequency of coders having
assigned this measurement to this unit.

WARNING: this function *will* change the data.table in `dt`. If you want to
avoid this, better calling it on a copy of the table.
