\details{
\dQuote{The conceivably simplest reliability data are generated by two
observers who assign one of two available values to each of a common set of
units of analysis. For example, suppose a political scientist is interested
in references to the United States in the Chinese press and, unable to read
Chinese, hires two individuals (Jon and Han) who claim to be competent
readers of Chinese to identify the presence or absence of such references.
They mark each newspaper article "0" for absent or "1" for present.}
