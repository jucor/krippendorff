#' Example reliability data set for two observers, binary data, from

#' TODO(jucor): cite Krippendorff 2004 properly

#' \dQuote{The conceivably simplest reliability data are generated by two
#' observers who assign one of two available values to each of a common set of
#' units of analysis. For example, suppose a political scientist is interested
#' in references to the United States in the Chinese press and, unable to read
#' Chinese, hires two individuals (Jon and Han) who claim to be competent
#' readers of Chinese to identify the presence or absence of such references.
#' They mark each newspaper article "0" for absent or "1" for present.}
