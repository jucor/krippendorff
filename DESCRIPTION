Title: Fast Krippendorff Alpha Reliability Measure
Version: 0.1.0

Description: Computes Krippendorff Alpha for reliability analysis, in a space-efficient manner especially
    suited for studies where each observer only grades a small fraction of a large number of observations.
    It provides both Krippendorff's alpha and its bootstrapping evaluation. This implementation is faster and more space-efficient than
    the more versatile `irr.kripp.alpha` package which offers several other reliability measures but requires
    the full observation matrix. TODO(jucor): Find how to cite Hayes 2007 properly
