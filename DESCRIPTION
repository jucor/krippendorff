Description: krippendorff computes Krippendorff Alpha for
    reliability analysis, in a space-efficient manner especially suited
    for studies where each observer only grades a small fraction of a
    large number of observations.  It provides both Krippendorff's alpha
    and its bootstrapping evaluation. This implementation is faster and
    more space-efficient than the more versatile `irr.kripp.alpha` package
    which offers several other reliability measures but requires the full
    observation matrix.
